# Gulp Start Environment

Following is the my preferred, configured gulp start environment, boilerplate for every project.

In order to use that environment you have to install and configure *node.js*, *gulp*, *bower* environment.

After its ready to use, you can download the repository, and call **npm install** in order to install all the packages which are pointed out inside *package.json*, and **bower install** in order to install all bower packages which are pointed out inside *bower.json* file.

Inside *index.html* you will find comments which allow to use and update packages installed by **bower package manager**.

Although there are comments where i use *Gulp* plugin for concatanating and merging _*.css_ and _*.js_ files to one **plugins.css** or **plugins.js** files to avoid multiple http:// requests...

You can use and fork repository for further improvements as well...
