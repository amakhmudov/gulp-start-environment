# Gulp Start Environment

Following is the my preferred, configured gulp start environment, boilerplate for every project.

In order to use that environment you have to install and configure node.js, gulp, bower environment.

After its ready to use, you can download the repository, and call npm install in order to install all the packages which are pointed and necessary to use inside package.json, and bower install in order to install all bower package manager configured inside bower.json.

Inside index.html you will find comments which allow to use and update packages installed by bower package manager.

Although there are comments where i use Gulp plugin for concatanating and merging *.css and *.js files to one plugins.css or plugins.js files to avoid multiple http requests...

You can use and fork repository for further improvements as well...
